 * - Linear: "forward", "backward", "stop"  
 * - Rotation: "turn_left", "turn_right"
 * - Strafing: "strafe_left", "strafe_right"
 * - Diagonal: "forward_left", "forward_right", "backward_left", "backward_right"
 * - Speed Control: "speed_slow", "speed_normal", "speed_fast"
 * 
 * API ENDPOINTS:
 * - POST /move - Execute movement commands
 * - GET /status - Complete system telemetry
 * - POST /emergency_stop - Immediate safety shutdown
 * - GET /health - System health check
 * 
 * HARDWARE CONFIGURATION:
 * - I2C Address: 0x38 (RoverC Pro)
 * - SDA Pin: GPIO 0
 * - SCL Pin: GPIO 26
 * - I2C Frequency: 100kHz

// This is the Arduino IDE wrapper file that includes all modular components
// The actual implementation is in the src/ directory for better organization

// Include main application entry point
#include "src/main.cpp"

// The setup() and loop() functions are defined in src/main.cpp
// Arduino IDE automatically calls these functions

 * 
 * Required Libraries (install via Arduino Library Manager):
 * - M5StickC by M5Stack (v0.2.5 or later)
 * - ArduinoJson by Benoit Blanchon (v6.21.0 or later)
 * - ESP32 Arduino Core by Espressif (v2.0.0 or later)
 * 
 * IMPORTANT: This firmware uses ONLY official/trusted libraries:
 * - M5Stack official hardware libraries
 * - Espressif official ESP32 framework components
 * - Arduino ecosystem standard libraries (ArduinoJson)
 * 
 * Third-party libraries are FORBIDDEN for security compliance.

 * FLASH LAYOUT:
 * - 0x1000: Bootloader
 * - 0x8000: Partition Table
 * - 0x10000: Application (1.2MB)
 * - 0x200000: SPIFFS (1.5MB) - Configuration, certificates, web assets
 * 
 * DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW:
 * 1. Flash firmware to M5StickC
 * 2. Connect to ESP-Rover-XXXX WiFi AP (password: rover123)
 * 3. Navigate to 192.168.4.1 in browser
 * 4. Configure WiFi credentials and AWS endpoint
 * 5. Rover will restart and connect to configured WiFi
 * 6. Access rover via assigned IP address on both ports 443 and 8443
 * 
 * SECURITY CHECKLIST:
 * ✓ All HTTP communication encrypted via HTTPS/TLS
 * ✓ Certificate validation for AWS communications  
 * ✓ Input validation and sanitization on all endpoints
 * ✓ No hardcoded credentials or secrets
 * ✓ Rate limiting on API endpoints
 * ✓ Secure credential storage in SPIFFS
 * ✓ Memory protection and overflow prevention
 * ✓ Watchdog timer for system reliability
 * ✓ Safe boot and recovery mechanisms
 * 
 * SAFETY CHECKLIST:
 * ✓ Tilt detection with configurable threshold
 * ✓ Emergency stop via multiple triggers
 * ✓ Battery voltage monitoring with cutoffs
 * ✓ Motor timeout protection
 * ✓ Recovery sequence with manual confirmation
 * ✓ Fail-safe defaults (motors off)
 * ✓ Redundant safety monitoring
 * 
 * PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT:
 * 1. Replace self-signed certificates with proper SSL certificates
 * 2. Configure production AWS endpoints
 * 3. Enable proper authentication and authorization
 * 4. Set up monitoring and logging infrastructure
 * 5. Implement OTA update mechanism
 * 6. Configure automated testing and validation
 * 
 * TROUBLESHOOTING:
 * - Serial Monitor: 115200 baud for debug output
 * - Physical Buttons: A=Debug Toggle, B=Emergency Stop
 * - Recovery Mode: Hold Button A during boot for safe mode
