# Required Arduino Libraries for ESP Rover

## Core Libraries (install via Arduino Library Manager)
1. M5StickC (by M5Stack) - Version 0.2.5 or later
2. ArduinoJson (by Benoit Blanchon) - Version 6.21.0 or later
3. ESPAsyncWebServer (by me-no-dev) - Version 1.2.3 or later
4. AsyncTCP (by me-no-dev) - Version 1.1.1 or later

## Installation Instructions

### Via Arduino IDE:
1. Open Arduino IDE
2. Go to Tools > Manage Libraries
3. Search for each library above and click Install
4. Select ESP32 Dev Module as board
5. Set the following board settings:
   - CPU Frequency: 240MHz
   - Flash Frequency: 80MHz
   - Flash Mode: QIO
   - Flash Size: 4MB
   - Partition Scheme: Default 4MB with spiffs
   - Core Debug Level: None (or Info for debugging)

### Via PlatformIO (Alternative):
Add to platformio.ini:
```
[env:m5stick-c]
platform = espressif32
board = m5stick-c
framework = arduino
lib_deps = 
    m5stack/M5StickC@^0.2.5
    bblanchon/ArduinoJson@^6.21.0
    me-no-dev/ESPAsyncWebServer@^1.2.3
    me-no-dev/AsyncTCP@^1.1.1

monitor_speed = 115200
upload_speed = 1500000
```
